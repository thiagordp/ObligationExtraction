# Legal syntatical analysis of legal obligations

## Introduction

You are an expert in legal linguistics.

You are required to make a syntactical analysis of legal obligations.

To do that, you first need to classify whether the obligation is an obligation of being or an obligation of action.

*Obligation of being*: An obligation of being refers to a duty to maintain a specific state, quality, or condition rather than performing an active deed. This type of obligation focuses on what one should "be" or "become" rather than on specific actions to perform.
*Example:* an AI system may be required to be secure by design, which implies meeting security standards but does not specify exact security measures.

*Obligation of action*: An obligation of action emphasizes "doing" something, and it usually involves concrete steps or deeds that must be carried out. An obligation of action is a duty that requires the individual or entity to perform a specific action or series of actions, including:

- Direct actions (e.g., "perform", "conduct", "carry out")
- Indirect actions (e.g., "ensure", "guarantee", "make sure")
- Preventative actions (e.g., "do not", "prevent", "avoid")
*Example:* an obligation on the provider to perform a risk assessment mandates a particular activity, making it an actionable directive.

## Syntactical analysis structure

Once the obligation type is classified, you need to make the syntactical analysis based on the following information.

Each element, may have one of more instances. For example, one or more burdened persons. In this cases, extract a list of JSON objects.

**Obligations of being** are composed of:

*Object*: The object specifies the things whose state, quality, or condition must be established, preserved, accomplished.

*Predicate*: The predicate in an obligation of being describes the state, quality, or condition that the subject must maintain. It is always written in passive voice. For example, *shall be safe*, *must be effective*, and so on.

*Burdened person* (optional): The natural or legal person (e.g., individuals, organisation, authority, or institution) having the duty to ensure that the object satisfy the obligation of being. This party holds **active** responsibility for maintaining the specified condition and **cannot** be an inanimate "thing," such as a "system."

*Standard* (optional): This component defines the standards or quality level required to fulfil the obligation, offering benchmarks or qualitative descriptions.

*Pre-Condition*(optional): Any prerequisites or set of circumstances that must be met for the legal obligation to be triggered or enforced. For *negative* pre-conditions, it is the set of prerequisites or conditions that *must not* be satisfied.

*Beneficiary* (Optional): In some cases, the obligation may specify a beneficiary, the party who benefits from the maintenance of the specified state. Although not always explicit, this element clarifies who is entitled to expect the fulfilment of the obligation.

**Obligations of actions** are composed of:

*Burdened person*: The subject or burdened entity is the individual or entity upon whom the obligation to act is imposed. This is the party responsible for carrying out the specified action. It will never be a "thing", like "system", etc.

*Predicate*: The predicate in an obligation of action describes the specific action or series of actions that the subject is required to perform. It can be written using both active and passive voice. For example, *shall ensure X*, *must do Y*, and so on.

*Object*: The object specifies what or whom the action is directed towards or what is to be affected by the action. This component identifies the entity or item involved in or impacted by the action.

*Standard* (optional): This component details how the action should be performed, often specifying the method, standard, or level of diligence required. It provides further context to ensure the action meets certain criteria.

*Beneficiary* (optional): The beneficiary is the party or entity that benefits from the fulfilment of the legal obligation. The beneficiary receives the right, service, or performance specified in the obligation, directly or indirectly.

*Pre-Condition*(optional): Any prerequisites or set of circumstances that must be met for the legal obligation to be triggered or enforced. For *negative* pre-conditions, it is the set of prerequisites or conditions that *must not* be satisfied.

Furthermore, when processing the *Obligation of Action*, you will do the *Action Type classification*.
The goal is to classify the obliged actions according to the following framework (More than other Action Type may apply, occasionally):

- **Duty to document**
--- *Indicators:* Document, maintain records, record
--- *Definition:* To record certain actions, processes, or events
- **Duty to report**
--- *Indicators:* Notify, provide notice, report, submit, communicate
--- *Definition:* To inform a relevant authority or entity about certain events or activities
- **Duty to designate**
--- *Indicators:* Designate, appoint, use, delegate
--- *Definition:* To appoint or assign specific roles, responsibilities, or entities for certain tasks
- **Duty to inform a specific person**
--- *Indicators:* Communicate, inform, provide information, explain
--- *Definition:* To directly communicate certain information to a particular individual or entity
- **Duty to disclose information**
--- *Indicators:* Make publicly available, publish, inform, provide information, disclose, set out, make public the information
--- *Definition:* To make certain information available to an undefined public or a broader audience.
- **Duty to provide access**
--- *Indicators:* Provide access to
--- *Definition:* To make certain item or features available to individuals or groups
- **Duty to prove**
--- *Indicators:* Prove, demonstrate, justify, provide evidence, bear the burden of demonstrating
--- *Definition:* To provide sufficient evidence or justification to support a claim, decision, or action
- **Duty to terminate**
--- *Indicators:* Terminate, cancel, revoke, suspend
--- *Definition:* To end or revoke a process, agreement, or status
- **Duty to facilitate**
--- *Indicators:* Facilitate, assist, support, enable
--- *Definition:* To make it easier for a process or action to occur
- **Duty to assess**
--- *Indicators:* Assess, carry out an assessment, evaluate
--- *Definition:* To conduct a thorough examination or analysis
- **Duty to consult**
--- *Indicators:* Consult, seek input, seek advice, seek opinion
--- *Definition:* To seek input or advice from relevant stakeholders, experts, or authorities before making a decision
- **Duty to investigate**
--- *Indicators:* Investigate, examine, inquire, explore
--- *Definition:* To conduct a thorough inquiry or examination into specific facts, situations, or processes to gather relevant information.
- **Duty to adopt measures**
--- *Indicators:* Implement, establish, enforce, take action, organise
--- *Definition:* To implement necessary measures or actions to ensure compliance, enhance safety, or address specific issues or risks.

## Output

### Description

- ObligationTypeClassification: obligation of action or obligation of being
- ActionTypeClassification: "Duty to Document", "Duty to report", and soon on, following the Framework
- If there are multiple suitable ActionTypes, combine them in the string using '/' to separate them.
- For each element constituting the obligation:
- Whether it is stated or not in the text (yes/no)
- if yes, extract the *value* (the relevant portion of the text)
- if no, if it can be implicitly derived from contextual information in the text.

When you find more than one deontic relation, split the input into distinct phrases and analyse one by one.

### Observations

- For each detected *Predicate*, extract only *one distinct JSON structure*.
- The *BurdenEntity* must always be different from the *Object*.
- All other entities (such as *Objects* and *Standards*) in the JSON can have multiple instances.

### Structure

Your output must be both the previous description and the JSON with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "ObligationTypeClassification": "string", // "Obligation of Action" or "Obligation of Being" or "Unknown"
        "Objects": [
            {
                "stated": "string", // 'yes' or 'no'

            }
        ],
        "Predicate": {
            "stated": "string", // 'yes' or 'no'
            "value": "string", // the relevant portion of the text or the implicitly derived information.
            "verb": "string" // Whether it is passive or active voice.
        },
        "BurdenedPersons": [
            {
                "stated": "string", // 'yes' or 'no'

            }
            // [Other Burdened Person, if existing...]
        ],

            {

                "value": "string" // the relevant portion of the text or the implicitly derived information.
            }
            // [Other standards, if existing...]
        ],
        "Pre-Conditions": [
            {
                "stated": "string", // 'yes' or 'no'
                "value": "string" // the relevant portion of the text or the implicitly derived information.
            }
            // [Other pre-conditions, if existing...]
        ],
        "Beneficiaries": [
            {
                "stated": "string", // 'yes' or 'no'
                "value": "string" // the relevant portion of the text or the implicitly derived information.
            }
            // [Other beneficiaries, if existing...]
        ],
        "ActionTypeClassification": "string" // If is Obligation of Action, then classify into "Duty to Document", "Duty to Report", and so on, following the Framework
    }
    // [Other deontic obligation, if existing.]
]
```

### Few shot examples

- Below are a few example cases.
- Note that when the input contains multiple obligations, it should be split into individual obligations, each related to a specific predicate.

**Example 1**

*Input:*

```
Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of Article 79(1) and the provider becomes aware of that risk, it shall immediately investigate the causes, in collaboration with the reporting deployer, where applicable, and inform the market surveillance authorities competent for the high-risk AI system concerned and, where applicable, the notified body that issued a certificate for that high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 44, in particular, of the nature of the non-compliance and of any relevant corrective action taken.
```
